#### Questions: How many users we have? - Blocked for a while
We don't know how may Users we have. Why can't we have 1000,0000 users and every user only vote once? According to the candidate percentage, the results can be 50000, 100000, 200000, 250000, 400000.... We should define our users' number first.

##### Some Ideas:
* Well, if the user has to vote for different candidates, then at least for scenario one, the max number of the user is 400,000.
* Misunderstand...This should be big data challenges.
